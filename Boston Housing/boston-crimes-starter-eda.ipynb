[According to some crime experts](https://www.oxygen.com/homicide-for-the-holidays/blogs/its-the-most-dangerous-time-of-the-year-why-do-crimes-increase), several types of crime tend to increase around the holidays, particularly larsony and robbery. This can occur for many reasons: crowded shopping centers create more cover for thieves, travelers leave their homes vulnerable to burglary, and increased alcohol and drug use can raise the likelihood of conflict-related crime. Let's see if there is any evidence for this in our data, focusing in on the year 2017.

In fact, many of these holidays appear to line up with especially low crime rates, particularly Thanksgiving and Christmas. Of course, this is data from just a single year, and detecting an association between a given holiday and crime rates would require a lot more data and a model that accounts for other factors. However, this does cause me to question the general idea that crime increases surrounding holidays - if that *is* true, it isn't super obvious from a birds-eye view of the data. Even the entire [\"holiday season\"](https://www.cpss.net/about/blog/2013/11/stay-safe-crime-rates-increase-during-holiday-season/) from Thanksgiving to Christmas doesn't seem to be especially elevated compared to the summer.  \n\n# Where do serious crimes occur?\n\nWe can use the latitude and longitude columns to plot the location of crimes in Boston.

Further analyses could explore how different types of crimes vary in time and space. I didn't even consider the less serious UCR Part Two and Part Three crimes, which are far more common than Part One crimes, but include interesting categories such as drug crimes.
