### Data Science and Exploratory Data Analysis

  * [Boston House Pricing](https://github.com/shravanambudkar/portfolio/blob/main/Boston%20Housing/boston_housing_regression_analysis_updated.ipynb): In this project exploratory visualisation is performed on Boston crimes dataset and 7 different models are evaluated and compared on the dataset to Identify the best price of the house considering crimes in the neighbourhood with the help of Machine Learning.

  * [Fakenews Classification and Analysis](https://github.com/shravanambudkar/portfolio/blob/main/fakenews%20classification/buzzfeed_news_analysis_and_classification.ipynb): The main purpose of this project is to develop methods to analyze fake news versus real news. This project is divided into two parts: (1) Exploratory Data Analysis (2) Classification. The goal of the first part is to analyze the real and fake news datasets to find sources that often published fake news and determine the most frequent words included in the title and body of fake and real news. The goal of the second part is to a classifer that can predict and detect fakenews. We use three different classifiers to classify documents into real/fake news categories.

  * [Bank customer segmentation](https://github.com/shravanambudkar/portfolio/blob/main/Bank%20customer%20segmentation/bank_customer_segmentation_updated.ipynb): In this project Bank customer segmentation is performed on German bank customer dataset. This project is carried out using exploratory data analysis method with the help of various python visualisation tools.

  * [Mall customer segmentation](https://github.com/shravanambudkar/portfolio/blob/main/mall%20customer%20segmentation/mall_customer_segmentation_k_means_analysis.ipynb): In this project Bank customer segmentation is performed on mall customer visit dataset. This project is carried out using exploratory data analysis method with the help of various python visualisation tools.

  * [Iris flower dataset](https://github.com/shravanambudkar/portfolio/blob/main/iris%20flower%20dataset/data_visualization_iris_dataset_seaborn_updated.ipynb): In this project we have performed simple exploratory data analysis of the Iris flower dataset and formed some strong conclusions through the analysis.

  * [Titanic dataset](https://github.com/shravanambudkar/portfolio/blob/main/iris%20flower%20dataset/data_visualization_iris_dataset_seaborn_updated.ipynb): In this project we have performed simple exploratory data analysis of the passengers onboard RMS titanic using pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.

  * [Uber data analysis](https://github.com/shravanambudkar/portfolio/blob/main/uber%20data%20analysis/cab-rides-detailed-eda-with-comments.ipynb): In this project we have performed simple exploratory data analysis of the uber cab rides dataset hosted on Kaggle. This analysis demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables.
